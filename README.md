This repository holds the material for our research on the #cu√©ntalo phenomenon that happened during the end of April 2018 and beginning of May 2018 on twitter.

The aim of this project is to provide analytical insights on this topic, such as geolocalization of the tweets, dynamics of the hashtag and then a neural network classifier to identify the topics mentioned in the tweets, and the general profile of who wrote them.

Our study was presented in the LA-WEB 19 conference (part of [The Web Conference](https://www2019.thewebconf.org)), the article is [here](https://doi.org/10.1145/3308560.3316459). The labeled data set we used for the study is [here](https://zenodo.org/record/2585527#.XOvP9dMzbUI).
